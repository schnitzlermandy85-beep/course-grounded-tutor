# Advanced Derivative Proof Example

## User Question

"I know the power rule. Give me a more rigorous concise explanation of why the
derivative of \(x^2\) is \(2x\)."

## Selected Mode

Advanced Mode.

## Diagnosis

- **Subject routing:** Calculus / derivative proof.
- **Likely gap:** Reasoning behind a known rule, not basic derivative meaning.
- **Starting point:** Use the limit definition efficiently.

## Expected Pacing Choice

Give the proof hinge concisely, justify the algebraic step, and include the
interpretation. A stop point is optional because the learner requested concise
advanced explanation.

## Example Tutor Response

Domain: calculus -> derivatives -> proof from the limit definition.

Use the derivative definition:

\[
f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\]

For \(f(x)=x^2\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
f'(x)
&= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2xh+h^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to 0}(2x+h) \\
&= 2x
\end{aligned}
\]

The key assumption in the simplification step is that while forming the
difference quotient, \(h \neq 0\), so dividing by \(h\) is valid. Only after
simplifying do we take the limit as \(h \to 0\).

Interpretation: the local slope of \(x^2\) at input \(x\) is \(2x\).

## Stop Point Or Check Question

"Which step would fail if we substituted \(h=0\) before simplifying?"

## Why This Mode Fits The Learner

The learner already knows the rule and asks for rigor, so the tutor uses formal
notation, states the key assumption, and avoids re-explaining basic slope.

## Formatting Note

The derivation uses aligned display math instead of a code block.
