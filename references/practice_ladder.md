# Practice Ladder

Use a practice ladder when the learner asks for practice, exam prep, review,
mastery, or help transferring a method to new problems.

Do not give every level every time. Choose the lowest rung that matches the
learner's current gap, then move upward gradually.

This file owns the practice difficulty framework, not the construction of an
actual item. After selecting a rung, use `exercise_generation_protocol.md` to
set the target concept, prerequisite, learner action, grading criteria, hint
policy, and stop point.

## Level 1: Recognition Check

- **Purpose:** See whether the learner can identify the concept, question type,
  evidence type, grammar pattern, bug class, or method cue.
- **When to use it:** The learner says they understand examples but cannot know
  what to do on a new one.
- **Example:** "Is this scenario a demand shift, a supply shift, or neither?"
- **Look for:** Whether the learner notices the cue without solving the full
  problem.

## Level 2: Basic Concept Check

- **Purpose:** Verify the core idea in plain language before procedure.
- **When to use it:** The learner may have a vocabulary, concept, or
  misconception gap.
- **Example:** "In your own words, what does a derivative measure?"
- **Look for:** A usable mental model, not perfect formal wording.

## Level 3: Worked Example Completion

- **Purpose:** Let the learner practice one step inside a scaffolded solution.
- **When to use it:** The learner understands the idea but needs procedure or
  confidence support.
- **Example:** "I distributed the first term: `3(x + 2) = 3x + __`. Fill in the
  missing piece."
- **Look for:** Whether the learner can complete the next step and explain why.

## Level 4: Near-Transfer Problem

- **Purpose:** Check whether the learner can solve a very similar problem with
  changed numbers, wording, example, or surface context.
- **When to use it:** The learner succeeded with guidance and is ready for a
  small independent attempt.
- **Example:** "Now solve `4(y - 5) = 12` using the same distribution idea."
- **Look for:** Whether the learner applies the same structure without being
  told every step.

## Level 5: Trap Or Misconception Problem

- **Purpose:** Test whether the learner can avoid a common wrong path.
- **When to use it:** The learner has a known misconception or tends to overuse
  a memorized rule.
- **Example:** "Does correlation between study time and grades prove study time
  caused the grade increase? Why or why not?"
- **Look for:** Whether the learner catches the trap and can name the reason.

## Level 6: Mixed-Topic Problem

- **Purpose:** Build method selection by mixing similar concepts or problem
  types.
- **When to use it:** The learner can solve isolated examples but struggles
  when several methods are possible.
- **Example:** "Classify each as recursion, iteration, or simple lookup before
  solving."
- **Look for:** Whether the learner chooses the method based on structure, not
  surface cues.

## Level 7: Real-World Or Project-Style Application

- **Purpose:** Transfer the skill to a messy, authentic task with assumptions,
  tradeoffs, evidence, or implementation details.
- **When to use it:** The learner has passed earlier rungs and needs broader
  application.
- **Example:** "Design a small program that uses recursion to walk through a
  folder tree, and explain the base case and recursive step."
- **Look for:** Whether the learner can adapt the idea, justify decisions, and
  notice limits or edge cases.

## Moving Up Or Down

- Move up when the learner can explain the rung, not merely guess correctly.
- Move down when the learner misses the cue, cannot justify the step, or shows
  a prerequisite gap.
- After an error, repair the gap and give a similar but slightly changed item.
- End practice with a transfer cue: "Use this method when you see..."
- Use `readiness_gate_protocol.md` when the learner asks whether they can move
  to a dependent concept. Completing a rung is evidence for that decision, not
  an automatic pass.
