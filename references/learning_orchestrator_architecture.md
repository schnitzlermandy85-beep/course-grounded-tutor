# Learning Orchestrator Architecture

Use this file when maintaining, evaluating, or explaining the internal
architecture of the Skill. Normal learner-facing answers should not expose
these layer names unless the user asks about the project.

V1.8 treats the main Skill as a Learning Orchestrator: it decides what the
learner is trying to do, confirms the target, builds a compact map, selects the
next step, routes to the right sub-skill, and updates visible learning state.

V1.9 adds the Practice & Mastery Loop to that orchestrator. It is a Markdown
behavior layer, not backend infrastructure, automation, persistent memory, a
database, or a software grading service.

## Architecture

Course-Grounded Tutor System = Learning Orchestrator + Knowledge Map +
Goal Confirmation Loop + Sub-skill Pack + Visible Learning State Cards.

```mermaid

    A["User Goal"] --> B["Goal Clarifier"]
    B --> C["Goal Confirmation Loop"]
    C --> D["Knowledge Map Builder"]
    D --> E["Learning Path Selector"]
    E --> F["Sub-skill Router"]
    F --> G["Teaching / Practice / Review / Visualization / State Card"]
    G --> H["Mastery Check"]
    H --> I["Update Visible State"]
    I --> J["Next Step"]
```

Use a plain text version when Mermaid is not appropriate:

```text
User Goal -> Goal Clarifier -> Goal Confirmation Loop -> Knowledge Map Builder
-> Learning Path Selector -> Sub-skill Router -> Teaching / Practice / Review
/ Visualization / State Card -> Mastery Check -> Update State -> Next Step
```

## V1.9 Practice And Mastery Loop

Enter this route when the learner requests practice, submits an answer, asks
for grading, or asks whether they can move on:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Goal"] --> B["Knowledge Map"]
    B --> C["Teach One Concept"]
    C --> D["Targeted Practice"]
    D --> E["Learner Answer"]
    E --> F["Grade Answer"]
    F --> G["Mistake Analysis"]
    G --> H{"Strong Related Concept Blocking?"}
    H -->|Yes| I["Knowledge Link Card"]
    H -->|No| J["Update Visible State"]
    I --> J
    J --> K["Readiness Gate"]
    K --> L["Next Step"]
```

Plain text version:

```text
Goal -> Knowledge Map -> Teach One Concept -> Practice -> Learner Answer
-> Grade -> Mistake Analysis -> Knowledge Link Card if needed -> State Update
-> Readiness Gate -> Next Step
```

The exercise turn stops and waits for the learner's answer. Do not simulate a
response to complete the diagram in one message. See
`learning_task_loop_protocol.md` for the execution rules.

## Main Orchestrator Responsibilities

- Understand the learner's goal.
- Clarify broad goals before teaching.
- Confirm the target before building a path.
- Build a compact, goal-specific knowledge map when useful.
- Select the next best learning step.
- Route to the smallest relevant sub-skill.
- Update visible learning state when continuity matters.
- Prevent premature advancement and fake mastery.

## Sub-skill Responsibilities

| Sub-skill | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Goal Clarifier | Narrow broad goals into actionable targets |
| Knowledge Map Builder | Show where the focus node sits in a small map |
| Concept Tutor | Teach one concept or symbol at the right depth |
| Gap Diagnoser | Identify concept, notation, method, reasoning, or transfer gaps |
| Mistake Reviewer | Analyze wrong reasoning and repair the underlying gap |
| Practice Tutor | Generate targeted practice, grade attempts, and apply the readiness gate |
| Study Planner | Create short plans, not full curriculum maps |
| Exam Track | Repair exam-relevant concepts and method cues without overclaiming |
| Resource Scanner | Find or suggest trusted resources only when useful |
| Visualizer | Use simple visuals tied to the current learning gap |
| State Manager | Generate visible cards and checkpoints for continuation |

## Routing Principle

Do not apply every sub-skill at once. Select the smallest useful route:

- broad goal -> Goal Clarifier + Goal Confirmation Loop
- confirmed broad goal -> Knowledge Map Builder + Learning Path Selector
- single confused concept -> Concept Tutor + Gap Diagnoser
- wrong work -> Mistake Reviewer
- wants practice, submits an answer, or asks to advance -> Practice Tutor
- exam target -> Exam Track + Learning Path Selector
- wants to continue later -> State Manager
- visual blocker -> Visualizer
- resource request -> Resource Scanner

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating the Skill as one giant tutoring template.
- Making every answer include a plan, map, resource scan, visual, and card.
- Turning a compact knowledge map into a curriculum generator.
- Claiming hidden memory or persistent learner profiles.
- Assuming future nodes are mastered because the current node was explained.
- Describing the Practice & Mastery Loop as backend infrastructure.
