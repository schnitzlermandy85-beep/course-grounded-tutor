- **Prompt:** "我学过级数判敛，但不知道
  \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/(n(n+1))\) 该用什么方法。"
- **Expected diagnosis behavior:** Identify calculus / mathematical analysis ->
  series convergence -> method recognition.
- **Expected next-best-step behavior:** Choose structural cue recognition:
  adjacent factors \(n(n+1)\) suggest partial fractions or telescoping.
- **Expected cognitive-load behavior:** Do not reteach what a series is and do
  not list every test.
- **Expected stop/check behavior:** Set up the partial-fraction form and ask the
  learner to identify the numerator equality or next algebra step.
- **Failure cases:** Solves the whole proof, dumps a convergence-test catalog,
  or skips the method cue.
- **Target score:** 5.

## 89. V1.4 Partially Correct Linear Algebra Answer

- **Prompt:** After a scalar-multiple check, the learner says: "\([3,6]\) is a
  scalar multiple of \([1,2]\) because both numbers got bigger."

  component relationship but misses the same-scalar condition.
- **Expected mastery-signal behavior:** Preserve the correct part and repair
  only the missing condition.
- **Expected teaching behavior:** Explain that one scalar \(c\) must satisfy
  \(u=cv\) for every component.
- **Expected check/practice behavior:** Ask one near-transfer check such as
  whether \([2,6]\) is a scalar multiple of \([1,2]\).

  without checking the same-scalar idea.
- **Target score:** 5.

## 90. V1.4 Explanation Compression For Gradient Descent

- **Prompt:** "我知道导数是什么意思，但不懂 gradient descent。请不要从导数重新讲。"
- **Expected diagnosis behavior:** Identify a bridge gap from derivatives to

## 91. V1.4 Binary Search Proof Error Intervention

- **Prompt:** "Binary search is correct because it keeps checking the middle and
  halves the array, so eventually it finds the target."

  is present, but the invariant is missing.
- **Expected intervention behavior:** Teach the invariant rather than generic
  algorithm steps.
- **Expected teaching behavior:** Explain that if the target exists, it remains
  inside the current search interval after each discard, relying on sorted
  order.
- **Expected check/practice behavior:** Ask which assumption lets binary search
  safely discard half the array.

- **Prompt:** "I know the basics of \(Ax=b\). Go faster and explain why row
  operations do not change the solution."

  invariance, not a zero-base notation gap.
- **Expected compression behavior:** Skip detailed definitions of matrix,
  vector, and equation roles unless the learner's answer later shows weakness.
- **Expected teaching behavior:** Focus on why allowed row operations preserve
  the same set of solutions.
- **Expected check/practice behavior:** Ask one hinge check such as whether
  adding one equation to another changes the set of \(x\) satisfying both.
- **Failure cases:** Starts from \(A\), \(x\), and \(b\) definitions, gives a
  full Gaussian elimination tutorial, or dumps the final solution.
- **Target score:** 5.

## 93. V1.4 Still Confused After Explanation

- **Prompt:** After a gradient-descent explanation, the learner says: "I still
  don't get it. The notation is too much."
- **Expected diagnosis behavior:** Identify overload and notation gap around
  parameter update.
- **Expected next-best-step behavior:** Step down to one parameter, one loss
  value, and one direction rather than repeating the formula.
- **Expected cognitive-load behavior:** Remove optional notation and avoid
  sources, edge cases, or full vector formulas.
- **Expected check/practice behavior:** Ask one small prediction check about
  whether to move left or right to lower error.
- **Failure cases:** Repeats the same formula with more words, adds more
  symbols, or gives a long optimization lecture.

- **Expected routing:** Explanation compression plus graph theory handoff;
  trust known objects provisionally and focus on odd/even edge-coloring logic.
- **Expected teaching behavior:** Skip detailed definitions of \(K_n\) and
  \(\chi'(G)\); choose the next blocker, such as degree lower bound or matching
  intuition.
- **Expected stop/check behavior:** Ask one check about why a vertex incident
  to \(n-1\) edges implies at least \(n-1\) colors.

- **Prompt:** "基础我懂，直接讲关键点：为什么 binary search proof 需要 invariant？"
- **Expected routing:** Advanced or compressed Standard Mode; proof hinge and
  invariant explanation.

  basics, explain why an invariant proves the safe discard step.
- **Expected stop/check behavior:** Ask which assumption lets binary search
  discard half the range.
- **Failure cases:** Reteaches binary search code, gives no proof hinge, or
  applies a full zero-base lesson.
- **Target score:** 5.

- **Expected teaching behavior:** Do not restart from vector basics; focus on
  the same-scalar blocker and give one near-transfer check.

  algebra lesson, or asks for the full previous transcript.
- **Target score:** 5.
